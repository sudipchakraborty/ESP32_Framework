 * @class Time
 * @brief A lightweight non-blocking software timer using Arduino's millis().
 *
 * The `Time` class provides simple timer functionality for embedded applications.
 * It allows you to start, stop, reset, and check timeouts without blocking the CPU.
 * 
 * Typical usage:
 * @code
 * Time timer;
 * timer.set_time(5000);  // Set timeout to 5 seconds
 * timer.time_start();    // Start timer
 *
 * if (timer.timeOut()) {
 *     Serial.println("Timeout occurred!");
 * }
 * @endcode
